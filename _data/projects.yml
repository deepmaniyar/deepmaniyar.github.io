    I participated in an Analytics Vidhya competition, where I achieved a rank in the top 20%. I performed data cleaning and preprocessing by leveraging concepts like feature engineering and feature selection. Used cross-validation to select the best hyperparameters achieving a root mean error squared of 0.967 (Best - 0.945)

    The task was to predict whether a given customer will churn based on features like user demographics and log data of users listening habits. I built a predictive model which detects user churn using Random Forest and  Gradient Boosting (Precision â€“ 97%). I also performed preprocessing steps for increased precision and used feature selection to decrease the computational cost.
